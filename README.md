# Net Ninja's Json-Server tut with UPDATE action
This is a repo to add an UPDATE example to the cool Net Ninja's Json-Server tut in YouTube:

He has done a nice work explaining how to use the awesome Node's JSON-SERVER plugin, after watch his tut and missing an UPDATE action, I decided code + run my own example based in everything I've learned.

This is what I'm sharing now, there are a few things I changed: /css and /js folders for its respective files and a constants.js file where I used to save some common data and other personal touches. In my computer I have occupied some ports so I decided to run the json-server in the port 9000, edit this file if you want run json-server in a different port number.
